You don’t have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function
You don’t have to handle the flag characters
You don’t have to handle field width
You don’t have to handle precision
You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't
You don’t have to handle the flag characters
You don’t have to handle field width
You don’t have to handle precision
You don’t have to handle the length modifiers
